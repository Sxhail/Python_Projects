1) Madlibs :  A fun word game where users input words of various types (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) to complete a pre-written story. The program then replaces placeholders in the story with the user's inputs to create a hilarious and often nonsensical result.
2) GuesstheNumber: A classic number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game provides hints to guide the player toward the correct answer.
3) ComputerGuessTheNumber: A role-reversal of the "GuesstheNumber" game. In this project, the player thinks of a number, and the computer tries to guess it within a set range, using a binary search algorithm or a similar strategy.
4) RockPaperScissors: A simple and popular hand game where the player chooses between "rock," "paper," or "scissors," and the computer also makes a choice. The winner is determined based on the rules of the game.
5) Hangman with Words File: A word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed; if not, it results in a wrong guess. The game continues until the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts. This project uses a predefined list of words from an external file.
6) TicTacToe with Player Separate File: The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players, where they take turns to mark the board with their respective symbols (X or O). This project includes a separate file for managing the game logic and provides a simple command-line interface for playing.
